    Begins the verification process for a member:
      - Sends reminders at intervals set in the configuration.
      - Uses a fixed start time so that the overall timeout is measured
        from the first invitation to verify rather than the last reminder.
      - Once the overall reminder timeout is reached:
           * If post_action is "send_dm" or "kick", the corresponding action is executed and the process ends.
           * If post_action is "continue_wait", the bot stops sending reminders and continues waiting.
      - Upon successful verification, a confirmation message is sent, which is customizable:
           * It can be enabled/disabled per server.
           * It can be sent via DM or in the welcome channel, per server configuration.
